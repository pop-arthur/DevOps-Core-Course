# Why Go?

**Language Selection: Go over Rust/Java**

**Binary Distribution**  
Go compiles to a single, dependency-free binary. No JVM to install like Java, no complex toolchains like Rust. Just copy the executable and run it on any server—perfect for DevOps tools.

**Development Speed**  
Go's compilation is near-instantaneous (1-2 seconds) vs Java's slower builds or Rust's lengthy compiles. The fast feedback loop lets me iterate quickly during development.

**Built-in Concurrency**  
Go has goroutines and channels built into the language. For a server handling multiple concurrent requests, this is simpler than Java's thread pools or Rust's ownership complexity.

**Standard Library Power**  
Go's standard library includes production-ready HTTP server, JSON handling, and TLS—no third-party frameworks needed. Java requires Spring Boot, Rust needs Actix or Axum.

**Ease of Maintenance**  
Go's straightforward syntax means any team member can understand the code. Rust's borrow checker and Java's verbose patterns create steeper learning curves for new contributors.
